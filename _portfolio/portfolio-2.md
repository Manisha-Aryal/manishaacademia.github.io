## What?
* Water treatment plant is designed with an aim to clean the waste water of Bagmati river situated in Kathmandu. We made the prototype of the treatment plant, used water sample taken from bagmati river, and processed it in the treatment plant we made. 

## Key components
* Coagulator:
</br>Coagulation is the chemical process of removing solid particles suspended in the water. This process introduces small, highly charged molecules into water to destabilize the charges on particles, colloids, or oily materials in suspension. Alum is used for coagulation.
* Flocculator:
</br>Flocculation is the process of removing the suspended particles from the water. After coagulation, large size particles are formed in the water, and they are skimmed properly in the flocculation process. Magnetic stirrer is used for flocculation. 
* Sedimentation and Decantation tank:
</br>In sedimentation tank, the water from flocculator is kept. For better sedimentation thin plates are placed parallel to the ground, decantation was done with the help of gravity. 
* Filteration:
</br>This is the final process. In this process, charcoal filter was used.
