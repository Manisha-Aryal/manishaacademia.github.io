Hey there! I am Manisha Aryal. I am a Mechanical Engineer by profession, and I am graduated from Pulchowk campus this year. Apart from Engineering I have a lot of other hobbies which I enjoyüê∞ which includes yoga, reading new books, sketching, plantation, cleaning, coding, watching TV series, running, skipping, playing basketball, guitar, and the list goes on and on and on.

## My hometown
My hometown is Aserdi. It is a beautiful place at the bank of Kaligandaki river. I enjoy living here a lot. It is peaceful, and everyone is so chill here. There is a school nearby my home and I see these school kids all the time, and talk to them. They make me laugh as they are kind and lighthearted too. We have a lot of plants in our home, and it makes me happy to see them maturing every day.
